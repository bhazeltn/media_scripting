My Sonarr/Radarr scripting

Using 1 Radarr for SD/HD movies, 1 for UHD, Sonarr for TV. Rclone to Google Drive Team Drive (4 remotes)

I use:
sickbeard_mp4_automator to transcode TV and SD/HD movies. UHD are not transcoded at this time
filebot to sort movies into genre based folders
rsync to update plex
rclone to move the files to Google Drive
unionfs-fuse

You will likely need to modify this heavily to suit your needs

This is a work in progress to merge 2 automation scripts

General workflow

Radarr / Sonarr processes file. Dumps info into JSON file
Script checks to see if it needs to process SD/HD, UHD, or TV
Transcodes (as needed)
Sorts/renames (as needed)
Uploads to Google
Updates Plex
